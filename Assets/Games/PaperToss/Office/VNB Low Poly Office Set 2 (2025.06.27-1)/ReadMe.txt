--- Description ---

New set following my previous Office Set (time to populate your office with new props I guess?) containing some more variations of the already present objects: more chairs, counters, lamps, paintings, desk and even donuts!

Smaller compared to the previous one, yet still useful if you want to create a low poly office themed level, animation or composition.

If you need help, or find some bug/problem, make sure to contact me (links at the bottom), same if you come up with suggestions for future themes!

If you liked the first 2 free office sets, want more and also want to support my work, you can check (and maybe buy) my 440+ individual models Office Set #3, with all new furniture options, including lots of new kind of models and multiple textures, with dedicated support! All for $30 (or up to 50% off from time to time lol)
---------- 

You're free to use every model the way you want for any commercial / non-commercial project. (comments and mentions are always welcome and certainly appreciated)

I shouldn't really need to clarify this, but just in case, remember you're not able to re-sell these models individually or as part of a model pack.

Please make sure to review the asset on itch.io if you found it useful, leave a comment there, along with any kind of suggestion (or problem you faced while using it) in order to improve it!

[Notes]
* Some models may contain a second material, used to add more variation to certain parts of the model itself.
